LEMOS Multi-Area Deployment Guide
================================

To monitor multiple areas, you need separate ESP32 devices:

AREA 1 ESP32:
- Flash: lemos_esp32_area1.ino
- areaId = "1"
- Sensors: MQ-4, MQ-7, DHT11, Ultrasonic, etc.

AREA 2 ESP32:
- Flash: lemos_esp32_area2.ino  
- areaId = "2"
- Same sensor configuration

AREA 3 ESP32:
- Flash: lemos_esp32_area3.ino
- areaId = "3" 
- Same sensor configuration

Each ESP32 will send data to the same Flask server but with different area_id values, allowing the system to track readings from all three areas separately.

WiFi Configuration:
- All ESP32s can use the same WiFi network
- All send data to the same server URL
- Server will differentiate by area_id field

Hardware Setup:
- Each area needs its own complete sensor setup
- Each ESP32 connects to sensors in its designated area
- LCD displays will show the respective area number
